# Abstract

The Poultry Farm Management System (PFMS) project addresses the prevalent issue of manual record-keeping in poultry farms, which is time-consuming, prone to disorganization, and inefficient. This project was initiated to solve the problems associated with traditional methods of farm management, including the difficulty of retrieving necessary data, a lack of real-time information sharing, and inefficiencies in monitoring farm operations. The research aimed to develop a comprehensive PFMS for Echo-Chick Farm to streamline operations, automate processes, and improve efficiency and productivity.

The objectives of the project included establishing a decentralized data model tailored for efficient poultry farm management, facilitating remote customer orders, and designing a system capable of generating comprehensive records. The methodology involved the development of a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, MySQL for the database, and PHP for backend intercommunication. Rigorous testing phases ensured the system's reliability and functionality.
Several challenges, including technical difficulties with module integration, user adaptation issues, and complex data migration processes, arose during the development process. Despite these challenges, the system successfully met its objectives, demonstrating robust functionality and ease of use. PIMS implementation has significantly improved information management and operational efficiency at Echo-Chick Farm.

The findings from the project suggest that automated systems can greatly improve farm management practices by providing reliable and accessible data, facilitating better decision-making, and reducing operational costs. The recommendations for future enhancements include continuous training for users, regular system upgrades, the development of efficient data migration tools, and the integration of user feedback to ensure the system evolves in line with user needs and industry trends.
